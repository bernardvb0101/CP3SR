# CP3SR
CP3 Spatial Report fully implemented using Python 3.10.
- Data can be pulled from a CP3 system via an API call provided that user rights are in place to do so.
- This require a username and password
- The app creates a spatial report in MSWord for the user after the user has made selections on which spatial feature he/she wants to report on.
This will be the first incarnation of the app without any session variables. It means no concurrent usage will be possible.
Subsequent versions may have the following additions:
- Session variables for concurrent usage
- Additional export capabilities to other file formats
- Access to the full functionality of the system via an API interface.
